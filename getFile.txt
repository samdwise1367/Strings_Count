Men Are from Mars
Women Are from Venus
Imagine that men are from Mars and women are from Venus. One day long ago the Martians,
looking through their telescopes, discovered the Venusians. Just glimpsing the Venusians
awakened feelings they had never known. They fell in love and quickly invented space travel
and flew to Venus.
The Venusians welcomed the Martians with open arms. They had intuitively known that this
day would come. Their hearts opened wide to a love they had never felt before.
The love between the Venusians and Martians was magical. They delighted in being together,
doing things together, and sharing together. Though from different worlds, they revelled in
their differences. They spent months learning about each other, exploring and appreciating
their different needs, preferences, and behaviour patterns. For years they lived together in love
and harmony.
Then they decided to fly to Earth. In the beginning everything was wonderful and beautiful.
But the effects of Earth's atmosphere took hold, and one morning everyone woke up with a
peculiar kind of amnesia selective amnesia.
